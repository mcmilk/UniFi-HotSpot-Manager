This is the directory, where the HotSpot manager will store some needed data.

Here is a small list of it:

#### languages.json
- the file defines the currently languages, which should be supported
- will be created with some default languagess, when needed

#### userdb.json
- user database, which is used for authentication
- will be created with one admin account, when the file is not there

#### source.po and source.csv
- these files can be used for translating
- they are re-generated by i18n_update_json()
- do not enable this in production use...

#### unifi.log
- when this file exists and is writeable, it will be used for debug logging
